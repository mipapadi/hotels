**Welcome to this project !!**
<br>  
My goal is to analyze hotel data and build a dashboard, that can give answers to the following stakeholder's questions:  
"Is our hotel revenue growing by year ?"  
"Should we increase our parcking lot size ?"  
"What trends can we see in the data ?"  
<br>
At first place, i used MS SQL Server to extract my data and load them to Power BI.  
But i wanted to try with postgresql in a more difficult way (for educational reasons).  
So the idea here was to use Docker, in order to create the database and using python to build the tables
with two different methods.  
Finally i extracted data and did my data analysis step with pure postgresql.
